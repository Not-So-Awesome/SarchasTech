# SarchasTech

Welcome to our project, where rants, ramblings, whinings, and complaints about all things tech (and sometimes not) find their voice. This project is a part of the Not-So-Awesome organization, where we believe in embracing the humorous side of life's annoyances.

## Project Purpose
Our project serves as a collection of comical and often satirical musings on the not-so-awesome aspects of technology and beyond. We encourage contributors to let their creativity flow as they share their tales of tech woe.

## Peer Review
To maintain the quality and humor of our content, everything submitted here must pass a peer review.

## Our Only Limit
While we welcome a wide range of perspectives, we do have one limit: we won't entertain some views that don't align with our organization's stance. For example, trashing open-source projects without validity is a no-go. Or defending radicalist or extremist organizations is also something that we don't allow.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Join our community of complainers by submitting your own witty tech complaints.
2. Participate in the peer review process to help curate the best content.
3. Follow our organization's rule: Don't be a dickhead.

## License (To Be Decided)
We are currently considering licensing options. However, please note that we do not support forks or the creation of alternate versions of our content without permission.
